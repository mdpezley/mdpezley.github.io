				<span class="note2">Infographic</span>
				<p><a href="Infographic.pdf" target="_blank">Infographic:</a><br>
				I designed this infographic to update DISTek’s employees on the results of the most recent employee satisfaction survey and reinforce the actions being taken to address employees’ concerns. This was part of a tiered communication plan - CEO presentation at Town Hall, CEO email to all employees (with this attached), and discussions during team meetings.</p><br>

				<p><a href="In the Air sample.pdf" target="_blank">Intranet Edition:</a></p><p>
					I worked with PrimeCo’s IT department to create a digital template for the company’s newsletter, <i>In the Air.</i>  This “modernized” edition allowed the company’s 3,000 employees to click on specific areas of interest and later search the archives for specific keywords.  This example includes an article which I wrote under President Lowell McAdam’s signature and two feature stories.

					<a href="newsletter sample.pdf" target="_blank">Email Edition:</a>  <p> 
					I wrote and published <i>In the Air </i>  twice a month to update PrimeCo's 3,000 employees about the company’s happenings.  Originally, I sent the newsletter out as an email attachment.  I included this edition rather than a current sample as my recent newsletter articles contain confidential information.</p>

					<a href="Rolling Thunder.pdf" target="_blank">Rolling Thunder Communications:</a> <p>
					I provided PrimeCo executives with support materials, talking points, and schedules to assist them in communicating key information, ensuring we had consistent messaging across the company.  This example went to the Senior Leadership Team and Vice Presidents/General Managers (VP/GMs) to help them update their employees on a $500 million network enhancement project.</p>
